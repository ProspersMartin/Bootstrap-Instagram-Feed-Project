# Bootstrap-Instagram-Feed-Project
  Developed this webpage, simulating a general instagram feed, to gain experience using bootstrap elements intergrated with some javascript functionality.

### Build / Layout
  The project was developed using Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, CSS, Font Awesome (for the Icons), and Google Fonts (to match the Instagram typography/iconography as closely as possible).
  
  The following image is the example I was supposed to model my work after (the minimum desired result):
